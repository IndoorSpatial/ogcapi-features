^|A |A server MAY support the PUT method on a non-existing resource. 
|===

In case PUT on a non-existing resource is supported, such a request can create a new resource with the `resourceId` specified in the URI of the resource endpoint.

To ensure that an update request is not treated as an insert, the client MAY specify an If-Match header in the update request. The service MUST NOT treat an update request containing an If-Match header as an insert.
