[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts. Each part is a separate standard.

By default, the complete feature is returned in a response. However, the client sometimes needs the geometry only at a certain scale or zoom level for presenting the feature on a map. A capability to restrict the response to the necessary detail can reduce the volume of data to be transmitted.

To address this use case, this Standard specifies how the representation of geometry, for example in a feature, can be simplified using a query parameter.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 7th part of the OGC API - Features standards.
