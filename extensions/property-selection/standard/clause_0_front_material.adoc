[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts. Each part is a separate standard.

By default, the complete feature is returned in a response. However, the client sometimes needs only selected properties and a capability to restrict the response to the necessary information can reduce the volume of data to be transmitted. Sample use cases are:

- The client does not need the geometry and only wants to present a table with property information. This option is in particular relevant for line strings, polygons or solids with many coordinates.
- The client only needs a subset of the properties, e.g. for styling the features in a map. This option is in particular relevant for features with many properties.

To address these use cases, this Standard specifies how the representation of a resource, for example a feature, can be reduced to selected properties of the resource using a query parameter.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 6th part of the OGC API - Features standards.
