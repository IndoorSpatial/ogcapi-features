[big]*i.     Abstract*

OGC API standards define modular API building blocks to spatially enable Web APIs in a consistent way. The <<OpenAPI,OpenAPI specification>> is used to define the API building blocks.

OGC API - Features provides API building blocks to create, modify and query
features on the Web. OGC API Features is comprised of multiple parts. Each
part is a separate standard.

Feature data often contains text properties.  This extension adds a query parameter to the OGC API Features suite of standards to support text or keyword searches on these text fields.

CAUTION: This is a DRAFT version of the 9th part of the OGC API - Features standards.
