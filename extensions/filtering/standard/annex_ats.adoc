== Abstract Test Suite (Normative)

This test suite uses the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Given-When-Then[Given-When-Then] notation to specify the tests.

In order to execute tests against the Web API under test, the Web API needs to support one of the specified encodings. Since all known implementations at this time support JSON, this test suite uses the JSON encoding and adds a dependency to the Conformance Class "JSON" in OGC API - Common - Part 1: Core for the general "Filter" tests and to the Conformance Class "GeoJSON" in OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core for the feature-specific tests. 

The Web API under test can require authorization. Any Executable Test Suite implementing this test suite should implement the following security schemes supported by OpenAPI 3.0: HTTP Authorization schemes "basic" and "bearer", API keys, and OAuth2 flow "authorizationCode".

=== Conformance Class "Queryables"

NOTE: The Conformance Class "JSON" in Common Core has a dependency to the Conformance Classes "Core" and "Landing Page"; that is, testing against "JSON" will automatically test against the dependencies.

The following table lists input given to all tests in this conformance class:

* The landing page URI of the OGC Web API (`{apiURI}`);
* A list of filterable resources in the API (`{apiURI}/{pathToResource}`);
* Authentication credentials (optional);

* the Web API under test passes the tests.

|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_filter_mixing-expressions,/req/filter/mixing-expressions>>
|Test purpose: | Check that a filter and a bbox parameter are evaluated with an AND
|Test method: | 
Given:

* test "get-queryables" was successful
* the list of collections 
* the spatial queryable of every collection
* the WGS84 bbox of every collection

When:

* a request for the resource that supports filtering is executed for every collection in the list (`collectionId`: JSONPath `$.collections[*].id`) with a filter expression with a spatial predicate, where the collection has a WGS84 bbox and a spatial queryable
** method: `GET`
** path: `{pathToResource}`
** query parameters (before percent encoding): `filter-lang={filter-lang}&filter={bbox-filter}&bbox={x1},{y1},{x2},{y2}` where `{spatialQueryable}` in `{bbox-filter}` is replaced by the spatial queryable, `{x1}` is replaced by the west-bound longitude of the WGS84 bbox of the collection, `{y1}` by the south-bound latitude, `{x2}` by the east-bound longitude, and `{y2}` by the north-bound latitude
** header: `Accept: {responseMediaType}`
** authentication, if authentication credentials are provided

Then:

* assert successful execution (the status code is in the list of acceptable status codes for a successful execution, `Content-Type` header is `{responseMediaType}`).
* assert that result contains the same features as the unfiltered result of the collection.

When:

* a request for the resource that supports filtering is executed for every collection in the list (`collectionId`: JSONPath `$.collections[*].id`) with a filter expression with a spatial predicate, where the collection has a WGS84 bbox and a spatial queryable
** method: `GET`
** path: `{pathToResource}`
** query parameters (before percent encoding): `filter-lang={filter-lang}&filter={bbox-filter}&bbox={x3},{y3},{x4},{y4}` where `{spatialQueryable}` in `{bbox-filter}` is replaced by the spatial queryable, `{x1}` is replaced by the west-bound longitude of the WGS84 bbox of the collection, `{y1}` by the south-bound latitude, `{x2}` by the east-bound longitude, `{y2}` by the north-bound latitude, and where the bbox `{x3}`,`{y3}`,`{x4}`,`{y4}` does not intersect the WGS84 bbox of the collection
** header: `Accept: {responseMediaType}`
** authentication, if authentication credentials are provided

Then:

* assert successful execution (the status code is in the list of acceptable status codes for a successful execution, `Content-Type` header is `{responseMediaType}`).
* assert that result contains no features.
