^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/queryables/get-queryables-response*
^|A |A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response
with an HTTP status code of `200`.
^|B |For responses that use `application/schema+json` as the `Content-Type` of
the response, the response SHALL have the following characteristics:

* The property `$schema` is `\https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema`.
* The property `$id` is the URI of the resource without query parameters.
* The `type` is `object` and each property is a queryable.
^|C |Each property SHALL include a `type` member, except for spatial properties.
^|D |Each spatial property SHALL not include a `type` or `$ref` member.
^|E |Each spatial property SHALL include a `format` member with a string value "geometry", followed by a hyphen, followed by the name of the geometry type in lower case. I.e., the values for the Simple Feature geometry types are: "geometry-point", "geometry-multipoint", "geometry-linestring", "geometry-multilinestring", "geometry-polygon", "geometry-multipolygon", and "geometry-geometrycollection". In addition, the following special values are supported: "geometry-any" as the wildcard for any geometry type, "geometry-point-or-multipoint" for a Point or MultiPoint, "geometry-linestring-or-multilinestring" for a LineString or MultiLineString, and "geometry-polygon-or-multipolygon" for a Polygon or MultiPolygon.
^|F |Each temporal property SHALL be a string literal with the appropriate format (e.g., `date-time` or `date` for instances, depending on the temporal granularity).
^|G |The `additionalProperties` member with a value of `true` or `false` is used
to state the behavior with respect to properties that are not explicitly declared 
in the queryables schema. 

If `additionalProperties` is missing or has the default value `true`, 
any property name is valid in a filter expression and the property reference SHALL 
evaluate to `null`, if the property does not exist for a resource. 

If `additionalProperties` is set to `false`, property references that are not 
explicitly declared in the queryables schema SHALL result in a `400` response.
