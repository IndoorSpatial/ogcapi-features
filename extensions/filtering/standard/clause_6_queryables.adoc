== Requirements Class "Queryables"

include::requirements/requirements_class_queryables.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the Queryables resource for discovering a list of
resource properties with their types and constraints that may be used to construct filter
expressions on a collection of resources, for example, a set of features.

This Standard does not assume that the content schema of a
resource being queried is available for inspection. Therefore, a means needs
to exist to interrogate an <<endpoint-def,endpoint>> to determine the names and types of the
properties that may be used to construct a filter expression
("queryables").

In addition, a <<publisher-def,publisher>> may want to support <<queryable-def,queryables>> that are not
directly represented as resource properties in the content schema of the
resource. Or the <<publisher-def,publisher>> may want to restrict filtering on certain
properties. For example, because the backend datastore has not been configured
to allow high-performance queries on those properties.

include::requirements/queryables/REQ_queryables-link.adoc[]

It is http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0#_link_headers[recommended to include the link in the response via an HTTP header].

include::requirements/queryables/REQ_get-queryables-op.adoc[]

The response is returned as a JSON Schema document that describes a single JSON object where each property is a queryable.

include::requirements/queryables/REQ_get-queryables-response.adoc[]

NOTE: The queryables schema does not specify a schema of any object that can be retrieved from the API. JSON Schema is used for the queryables to have a consistent approach for describing schema information. The queryables schema describes a "virtual" resource view for the purpose of filtering. JSON Schema will also be used in Part 5: Schemas of OGC API Features to describe schemas for feature content.

To support clients, providing additional detail about the meaning of the
queryable properties and their value range is recommended:

.Filtering on complex data structures
====
Queryables also support simplified filtering on complex data structures. This example illustrates one potential approach to define a queryable on specific https://stacspec.org[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)] assets. The following is a STAC snippet:

[source,JSON]
----
"features": [
  {
    "type": "Feature",
    "assets": {
      "B5": {
        "eo:bands": [
          {
            "common_name": "nir",
            "name": "B5"
          }
        ],
        "href": "https://landsat-pds.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c1/L8/060/247/LC08_L1TP_060247_20180905_20180912_01_T1/LC08_L1TP_060247_20180905_20180912_01_T1_B5.TIF",
        "type": "image/tiff; application=geotiff; profile=cloud-optimized"
      }
    }
  }
]
----

A common type of filter is to fetch only resources that have in their `assets` object a value that has an `eo:bands` value that contains a `common_name` value of "nir". 

This could be implemented using a queryable `common_band_names` defined as an array of strings:

[source,JSON]
----
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "$id": "https://example.net/stac/collections/landsat/queryables",
  "type": "object",
  "title": "A STAC item",
  "properties": {
    "common_band_names": {
      "title": "Common band names",
      "description": "an array of common band names included in the assets",
      "type" : "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Internally this could be mapped to the following JSON Path for a STAC item (`item`): 

`item['assets'][\*]['eo:bands'][\*]['common_name']`

Note that the JSON Path is just included here to clarify the mapping. An implementation would use a mapping that fits its backend datastore, but these details are hidden from the user.

A client can now use, e.g., the CQL2 array predicates to filter with the queryable. Examples using the CQL2 text encoding:

* `A_CONTAINS(common_band_names, ["nir"])` - includes at least a 'nir' band
* `A_EQUALS(common_band_names, ["nir","blue"])` - 'nir' and 'blue' exist for the feature, but no other band
