== Requirements Class "Basic CQL2"

[[basic-cql2-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-cql2.adoc[]

This clause defines the core of a query language called `Common Query Language`
(CQL2) that may be used to construct filter expressions. This core is called Basic CQL2.

Subsequent clauses define additional filtering capabilities as well as several
encodings of CQL2.

[[basic-cql2_filter-expression]]
=== CQL2 filter expression

A CQL2 filter expression is an expression that defines a logically connected set of predicates that are evaluated for each item of a collection. Each predicate is an operator with operands where the number of operands depends on the operator. An operand is either a literal, a property, a standardized or custom function or an arithmetic expression.

A predicate is an expression that evaluates to the Boolean values of `TRUE` or `FALSE` or that evaluates to the value `NULL` when dealing with unknown values.
Logically connected predicates are evaluated according to the following truth table:

[reftext='{table-caption} {counter:table-num}']
.Truth table of evaluating CQL2 predicates
[width=75%,cols="15,15,35,35",options="header"]
|===
|Predicate1 |Predicate2 |Predicate1 AND Predicate2 |Predicate1 OR Predicate2
|TRUE |TRUE |TRUE |TRUE
|TRUE |FALSE |FALSE |TRUE
|FALSE |TRUE |FALSE |TRUE
|FALSE |FALSE |FALSE |FALSE
|TRUE |NULL |NULL |TRUE
|FALSE |NULL |FALSE |NULL
|NULL |TRUE |NULL |TRUE
|NULL |FALSE |FALSE |NULL
|NULL |NULL |NULL |NULL
|===

A collection item that satisfies ALL the requirements of a CQL2 filter expression according to the above true table evaluates to a Boolean value of `TRUE`; otherwise the CQL2 filter expression evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL`.

If a CQL2 filter expression evaluates to `TRUE` for an item, the item is included in the result set and is thus available for further processing such as presentation in a response document.

If a CQL2 filter expression overall evaluates to `FALSE` or `NULL` for an item, the item is not included in the result set and is thus not available for further processing.

include::requirements/basic-cql2/REQ_cql2-filter.adoc[]

Literal values do not have to be supported on the left-hand side of predicates and property references do not have to be supported on the right-hand side of
predicates.

include::recommendations/basic-cql2/PER_cql2-filter.adoc[]

A Basic CQL2 filter expression can be constructed by logically connecting comparison predicates.

Support for the parts of CQL2 that are not part of Basic CQL2 is added in additional
requirements classes in <<cql2-enhancements>>:

* The rules `isLikePredicate`, `isBetweenPredicate` and `isInListPredicate` are added by requirements class <<rc_advanced-comparison-operators,Advanced Comparison Operators>>;
* Support for the `CASEI` function is added by requirements class <<rc_case-insensitive-comparison,Case-insensitive Comparison>>;
* Support for the `ACCENTI` function is added by requirements class <<rc_accent-insensitive-comparison,Accent-insensitive Comparison>>;
* The rule `spatialPredicate` is added by requirements classes <<rc_basic-spatial-functions,Basic Spatial Functions>> and <<rc_spatial-functions,Spatial Functions>>;
* The rule `temporalPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_temporal-functions,Temporal Functions>>.
* The rule `arrayPredicate` is added by requirements class <<rc_array-functions,Array Functions>>;
* The permission to not support the literal rules on the left-hand side of predicates and the rule `propertyName` on the right-hand side is removed by requirements class <<rc_property-property,Property-Property Comparisons>>;
* The rule `function` is added by requirements class <<rc_functions,Functions>>;
* The rule `arithmeticExpression` is added by requirements class <<rc_arithmetic,Arithmetic Expressions>>.

Examples of Basic CQL2 filter expressions are included in the subsequent sub-clauses.

[[basic-cql2_data-types-and-literals]]
=== Data types and literal values

This section documents the data types supported by Basic CQL2 and has examples 
of literal values for each data type. 

A literal value is any part of an CQL2 filter expression that is used
exactly as it is specified in the expression.

Other requirements classes add more data types. These are defined in the chapter
specifying the requirements class.

[[scalar-data-types]]
==== Scalar data types

The scalar data types are:

* "string": character strings (rule `characterLiteral`);
* "number": numbers including integers and floating point values (rule `numericLiteral`);
* "boolean": booleans (rule `booleanLiteral`);
* "timestamp": an instant with a granularity of a second or smaller (rule `timestampInstant`)
* "date": an instant with a granularity of a day (rule `dateInstant`)

For character string, numeric and boolean literals, the standard representations are used. 

Conceptually, an instant is a "temporal entity with zero extent or duration" [<<owl-time,Time Ontology in OWL>>]. In practice, the temporal position of an instant is described using data types where each value has some duration or granularity that is sufficient for the intended use of the data. 

CQL2 supports two commonly used granularities: a second or smaller (data type "timestamp") and days (data type "date"). Literal timestamps are always in the time zone UTC ("Z"), dates are local dates without an associated time zone. 

If time zone information is important for the intended use, then the "date" data type should not be used and the temporal information should be provided as an interval with start and end timestamps.

NOTE: While instants (timestamps and dates) are scalar data types that can be used with the basic comparison operators, intervals are more complex data types. Support for intervals is added in the requirements class <<rc_temporal-functions,Temporal Functions>> where intervals can be provided as arguments in temporal comparison functions.

For timestamp and date values representations based on RFC 3339 are used:

* Text: a `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` constructor with a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6[RFC 3339 `date-time` or `full-date` string]
* JSON: an object with a `date` or `timestamp` member with a https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339.html#section-5.6[RFC 3339 `date-time` or `full-date` string]

==== Escaping in string literals

In general, escaping special character sequences in a string literal will be handled according to the rules of the specific encoding being used.  For example, for the JSON encoding of CQL2, an embedded newline in a string literal would be encoded as `\n`.  If, however, an XML encoding of CQL2 existed the embedded newline character would be encoded as `&#xA`.  Furthermore, additional processing of a string literal may be necessary before it can be passed down to an underlying platform (e.g. RDBMS) for further handling.

For the text encoding of CQL2 see <<cql2-text>> and requirement <<req_cql2-text_escaping,/req/cql2-text/escaping>> for additional requirements concerning escaping in string literals.

[[type-casts]]
==== Type casts

include::recommendations/basic-cql2/PER_type-casts.adoc[]

This Standard does not prescribe how types are cast. The evaluation of filter expressions that involve type casts will, therefore, be system dependent.

For example, a system that evaluates an expression `'5' > 4` can, for example,

* throw an error (incompatible types in a comparison operator);
* cast the number to a string (`'5' > '4'`);
* cast the string to a number (`5 > 4`).

[[basic-cql2_identifier]]
=== Identifiers

An identifier is a token that represents a resource or a named part of a resource within a CQL2 expression that is not a CQL2 keyword or command.  Identifiers are composed of a sequence of UTF-8 characters.  Valid starting characters for identifiers can include the colon (i.e. ":"), the underscore (i.e. "_") and letters of the alphabet (e.g. "A-Z, a-z").  Additional continuing characters in an identifier can include the period (i.e ".") and numeric digits (i.e. "0-9").  The `identifier` production in the <<cql2-bnf,CQL2 BNF>> enumerates the specific characters that can be used to start an identifier as well as additional identifier continuing characters.

[[basic-cql2_property]]
=== Property references

Properties in an object being evaluated in the CQL2 filter expression can be
referenced by their name (rule `propertyName`).

include::requirements/basic-cql2/REQ_property.adoc[]

For example, a property name used in a scalar expression (rule `scalarExpression`)
has to be a queryable of type `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `date`, or `timestamp`.

[[basic-cql2_comparison-predicates]]
=== Standard comparison predicates

include::requirements/basic-cql2/REQ_binary-comparison-predicate.adoc[]

include::recommendations/basic-cql2/REC_string-normalization.adoc[]

Instants (timestamps and dates) are scalar data types. All implementations have to support the comparison of two timestamps or two dates. How this is implemented is a decision of the server and will depend on the internal representation. For example, the server could compare the RFC 3339 string representations of the two timestamps.
