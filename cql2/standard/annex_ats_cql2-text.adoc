|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | all requirements
|Test purpose: | Validate that CQL2 Text is supported by the server
|Test method: | 
Given:

* n/a

When:

==== Conformance Test {counter:test-id}
[cols=">20h,<80a",width="100%"]
|===
|Test id: | /conf/{conf-class}/{conf-test}
|Requirements: | <<req_{conf-class}_escaping,/req/{conf-class}/escaping>>
|Test purpose: | Test escaping in string literals.
|Test method: | 
Given:

* One or more data sources containing string literals with embedded single quotation (`'`) and/or BELL, and/or BACKSPACE, and/or HORIZONTAL TAB, and/or NEWLINE, and/or VERTICAL TAB, and/or FORM FEED, and/or CARRIAGE RETURN characters.

When:

Decode each string literal.

Then:

* assert that the escaped embedded characters have been correctly recovered.
