[[case-insensitive-comparison]]
=== Requirements Class "Case-insensitive Comparison"

include::requirements/requirements_class_case-insensitive-comparison.adoc[]

The following requirements class adds support for case-insensitive string comparisons.

This capability is useful to operate across data that has not been normalized or has been normalized to values that are different than they should be. This is implemented via a standardized string function to normalize a string with respect to case (`CASEI`).

For example, the `CASEI` function is useful when a property is set to "PLANET", "Planet", or "planet" and one wants to match either without having to enumerate all the variations.

Implementations of the `CASEI` function can be complex and depend on the locale, but in many cases the underlying datastore will provide a capability that the function can be mapped to.

====

The `CASEI` function returns a string typed representation of the input expression that is guaranteed to be equal to any other case insensitive representation of that string.  In order to ensure correct comparisons, the function should be applied to both sides of an expression. So, for example, the only durable case-insensitive equality comparison would be `CASEI(some_property) = CASEI('Straße')`.  An expression such as `CASEI(some_property) = 'strasse'` might work but is not guaranteed to work across implementations or between versions of the same implementation.

[[accent-insensitive-comparison]]
=== Requirements Class "Accent-insensitive Comparison"

include::requirements/requirements_class_accent-insensitive-comparison.adoc[]

This requirements class adds support for accent-insensitive string comparisons to operate across data that has not been normalized or has been normalized to values that are different than they should be.

Similar to the case-insensitive comparison, this capability is supported via a string function `ACCENTI`.

For example, the `ACCENTI` function is useful when accents (or, more generally, diacritics not available in ASCII) were dropped when indexing a property. This may be useful, for example, to support users that are not familiar with accents or that do not know how to type them on their keyboard. For example, "papa" would also match "papá". Note that accent-insensitive comparisons can match values with a different meaning. E.g., in Spanish "papa" is potato and "papá" is father. "papá" in an accent-insensitive comparison will match both, but this may also be intentional, because the users knows that some of the data has been processed in ASCII.

Implementations of the `ACCENTI` function can be complex, but in many cases the underlying datastore will provide a capability that the function can be mapped to.

====

Like `CASEI`, the `ACCENTI` function returns a string typed representation of the input expression that is guaranteed to be equal to any other accent insensitive representation of that string. In order to ensure correct comparisons, the function should be applied to both sides of an expression.  So, for example, the only durable accent-insensitive equality comparison would be `ACCENTI(some_property) = ACCENTI('papá')`. An expression such as `ACCENTI(some_property) = 'papa'` might work but is not guaranteed to work across implementations or between versions of the same implementation.

[NOTE]
====
_**Implementation guidance for ACCENTI()**_

The implementation of an ACCENTI() function requires the use of fields 3 and 5 from https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt[UnicodeData.txt] and the application of the Unicode Normalization Algorithm (NFD or NFKD) by:

* Recursively replacing code points in the source string by their field 5 Decomposition Mappings for those rows with canonical mappings (i.e. those mappings not prefixed by a tag from https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/#Character_Decomposition_Mappings[Table 14], or any of them if applying NFKD; the decomposition type is also available in https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/extracted/DerivedDecompositionType.txt[DerivedDecompositionType.txt]).
* Applying special rules to decompose Hangul syllables which do not have a decomposition mapping set up.  There are some details in http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/ch03.pdf Section 3.12 of the Unicode Standard (from page 142) and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41309402/breaking-down-a-hangul-syllable-into-letters-jamo. The following C code implements the hangul syllable decomposition:

[source,C]
----
if(codePoint >= 0xAC00 && codePoint < 0xD7B0)
{
   unsigned int syllable = codePoint - 0xAC00;
   unsigned int t = syllable % 28, v, l;
   syllable /= 28;
   v = syllable % 21, l = syllable / 21;
   add(0x1100 + l);
   add(0x1161 + v);
   if(t) add(0x11A7 + t);
}
----

* Applying the Canonical Ordering algorithm which is stable-sorting (e.g., bubble-sort) the decomposed mapping code points by the value of that combining class for any sub-string where the Combining Class (field 3) (also in https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/extracted/DerivedCombiningClass.txt[DerivedCombiningClass.txt]) value is non-zero. This step is necessary if there were combining marks in the source text; the Decomposition Mappings should otherwise already be in the correct order. The canonical ordering will only matter for code points that do not get stripped, so it will not matter for any of the combining characters that are non-spacing marks.

then:

* Removing Nonspacing Marks (category `Mn`) (general category is field 2 of https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt[UnicodeData.txt], also available in https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/extracted/DerivedGeneralCategory.txt[DerivedGeneralCategory.txt]).
* An exception should be made for some characters categorized as `Mn`, as stripping some non-spacing marks -- like the Japanese voicing marks (dakuten [ ゛] U+3099 and handakuten [゜] U+309A) -- can be a lossy change that would turn はじめ "hajime" (beginning) into はしめ "hashime" (fastener).

[[basic-spatial-functions]]
=== Requirements Class "Basic Spatial Functions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-spatial-functions.adoc[]

A _spatial predicate_ evaluates two geometry-valued expressions to determine if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified spatial comparison function.

[[basic-spatial-data-types]]
==== Basic spatial data types and literal values

The basic spatial data types are (part of rule `spatialInstance`):

* "Point": a point;
* "BBox": a bounding rectangle or box.

For the Point data type, the following representations are used for literal values:

* Text: an OGC Well-Known Text (WKT) literal (see clause 7 of <<ogc06-103r4,Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>)
* JSON: a GeoJSON geometry object (see clause 3.1 of <<GeoJSON,GeoJSON>>)

For the BBox data type:

In the Text representation, the type is encoded as a `BBOX()` spatial comparison function with four or six numerical arguments, depending on whether the coordinates include a vertical axis (height or depth):

* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
* Minimum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
* Maximum value, coordinate axis 3 (optional)

In cases where the bounding box spans the antimeridian of a geographic coordinate reference system, the lower-left value (west-most box edge) is larger than the upper-right value (east-most box edge).

If the vertical axis is included, the third and the sixth number are the bottom and the top of the 3-dimensional bounding box.

In JSON, the BBox type is encoded as a JSON object with a "bbox" member with an array with four or six numbers. This representation is consistent with the GeoJSON representation of a bounding box (see clause 5 of <<GeoJSON,GeoJSON>>).

Since WKT and GeoJSON do not provide a capability to specify the CRS of a geometry literal, the server has to determine the CRS of the geometry literals in a filter expression through another mechanism. For example, a query parameter `filter-crs` is used in <<OGCFeat-3,OGC API - Features - Part 3: Filtering>> to pass the CRS information to the server.

include::requirements/requirements_class_basic-spatial-functions-plus.adoc[]

This requirements class is similar to the <<basic-spatial-functions,Basic Spatial Functions>> requirements class except it removes the restrictions on the spatial literals that can participate in the expression.

[[additional-spatial-data-types]]
==== Additional spatial data types and literal values

In addition to the spatial types listed in the <<basic-spatial-functions,Basic Spatial Functions>> requirements class (i.e. "Point", "BBox"), this requirements class allows the following Spatial Literals (part of rule `spatialInstance`):

* "LineString": a curve with linear interpolation between the vertices;
* "Polygon": a planar surface bounded by closed line strings;
* "MultiPoint": a collection of points;
* "MultiLineString": a collection of line strings;
* "MultiPolygon": a collection of polygons;
* "GeometryCollection": a collection of one or more of "Point", "Polygon", "MultiPoint", "MultiLineString", or "MultiPolygon" instances;

include::requirements/basic-spatial-functions-plus/REQ_spatial-data-types.adoc[]

The following representations are used for literal values:

* Text: an OGC Well-Known Text (WKT) literal (see clause 7 of <<ogc06-103r4,Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>>)
* JSON: a GeoJSON geometry object (see clause 3.1 of <<GeoJSON,GeoJSON>>)

[[spatial-functions]]
=== Requirements Class "Spatial Functions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_spatial-functions.adoc[]

This requirements class adds:

* a set of Dimensionally Extended Nine-intersection Model (DE-9IM) relation operators that may be used to add spatial predicates to a CQL2 filter expression. These operators are implemented in CQL2 as standardized functions.

==== Spatial Functions

include::requirements/spatial-functions/REQ_spatial-functions.adoc[]

This clause specifies a set of standardized spatial comparison functions that can be used to evaluate whether a specific spatial relationship exists between a pair of geometries.  

The definition of these spatial comparison functions is based on a Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model (DE-9IM) and further discussion and explanation about this model can be found at <<DE-9IM,DE-9IM>> and <<PostGIS-26,Dimensionally Extended 9-Intersection Model>>.

Consider geometries `a` and `b`.

The spatial relationships between `a` and `b` can be represented by the following intersection matrix (see <<DE-9IM,DE-9IM>>):

[#figure20]
.The DE-9IM intersection matrix.
image::images/DE9IM_Matrix.png[alt=Within,width=70%]

`I()` represents the set of all positions in the <<interior-def,interior>> of the geometry, `B()` represents the set of all positions on the <<boundary-def,boundary>> of the geometry and `E()` represents the set of all <<exterior-def,exterior>> positions.  `dim()` represents the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension[dimension] of the intersection of the interior (`I`), boundary (`B`) and exterior (`E`) of geometries `a` and `b`.

The value of each cell in this intersection matrix is either:

* `0` (i.e. the dimension of the intersection is a point),
* `1` (i.e. the dimension of the intersection is a line),
* `2` (i.e. the dimension of the intersection is an area) or,
* `∅` for the empty set or no intersection.

These values are sometimes simplified to:

* `T` representing `{0,1,2}` (if the actual value of the dimension does not matter),
* `F` representing the empty set and,
* `*` representing a value that is not relevant to the evaluation of a spatial comparison function.

An example of such an intersection matrix is:

stem:[[[T,"*",F\],["*","*",F\],[F,F,"*"\]\]]

The following table lists the mathematical definitions of each standardized spatial comparison function as described in <<ogc06-103r4,OpenGIS® Implementation Standard for Geographic information - Simple feature access - Part 1: Common architecture>> and also using DE-9IM.

[[temporal-functions]]
=== Requirements Class "Temporal Functions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_temporal-functions.adoc[]

A temporal predicate evaluates two time-valued expressions to determine, if the expressions satisfy the requirements of the specified standardized temporal comparison function.

The operands in a temporal predicate are temporal geometries. A temporal geometry is either an instant or an interval.

==== Temporal data types and instances

An instant is either a date (rule `dateInstant`) or a timestamp (rule `timestampInstant`) in accordance with <<rfc3339,RFC 3339>> (RFC 3339 rules `full-date` or `date-time`). Note that since time is continuous, every instant has a duration and a start/end. Nevertheless, the geometry can be considered an instant in the temporal resolution that is applicable for the specific property.

An interval is the time between a start instant and an end instant, including both bounding instances (rule `intervalInstance`). Unbounded interval ends are represented by a double-dot string ("..") based on the convention specified in ISO 8601-2.

CQL2 follows ISO 8601-1/ISO 8601-2 in defining intervals as closed at both start and end. Note that some implementations and other specifications use a different definition and it may be necessary to convert between the interval representations. For example, SQL uses half-closed intervals - closed at the start, open at the end.

Depending on the implementation environment, the underlying datastore may or may not support intervals as data types of properties. If not, intervals are typically represented by two separate properties that are instants, one for the start and one for the end of the interval.

All temporal geometries are in the Gregorian Calendar. This is a deliberate restriction to keep implementations of CQL2 simple, avoiding requirements to transform time instants to other temporal coordinate reference systems, but still cover a large number of use cases. This is consistent with the use of RFC 3339 as a key standard for expressing date and time on the internet, including in the OGC API Standards.

For intervals, the following representations are used:

* Text: an `INTERVAL` function with two instants or double-dot strings as parameters;
* JSON: an object with an `interval` member with an array of two instants or double-dot strings as parameters.

In case two instants are provided, both instants have the same granularity (i.e., they are either timestamps or dates).

NOTE: Instants are also scalar data types; for the representations and examples of instances see <<scalar-data-types>>.

==== Temporal Functions

The standardized temporal comparison functions in CQL2 are based on the temporal operator definitions in the <<owl-time,W3C/OGC Time Ontology in OWL>>.

NOTE: <<per_basic-cql2_time-instant-comparison,Simple temporal predicates>> involving time instants can also be evaluated using the <<basic-cql2_comparison-predicates,standard comparison operators>>.

The following table specifies the definition of the standardized temporal comparison functions where both operands may be instants or intervals, including mixed combinations.

Additional temporal comparison functions are available, but only applicable for intervals. Using these functions with instants will result in a client error.

==== Type casts

As stated in <<type-casts>>, the evaluation of filter expressions that involve type casts is system dependent.

For example, a system that evaluates the interval `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')` can, for example,

* throw an error (incompatible types in an interval);
* cast the value to an interval of dates, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01','2022-04-11')`;
* cast the value to an interval of timestamps, e.g., `INTERVAL('2022-01-01Z00:00:00Z','2022-04-11T12:41:13Z')`.

This clause specifies requirements for supporting array expression in CQL2.

==== Arrays

An array is a bracket-delimited, comma-separated list of array elements. An array element is either a scalar value,
a geometry, an interval, or another array.

==== Array Functions

Array expressions can be tested in a predicate for equality, if one array
is a subset of another, if one array is a superset of another or if two
arrays overlap or share elements using a standardized set of array comparison
functions.

[[arithmetic]]
=== Requirements Class "Arithmetic Expressions"

include::requirements/requirements_class_arithmetic.adoc[]

This clause specifies requirements for supporting arithmetic expressions in CQL2.
An arithmetic expression is an expression composed of an arithmetic operand
(a property name, a number or a function that returns a number), an arithmetic
operator (i.e., one of `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `div`, or `^`) and another arithmetic operand.

`+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` are the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). In addition, the modulo operator (`%`), integer division (`div`), and the exponention operator (`^`) are supported.

include::requirements/arithmetic/REQ_arithmetic.adoc[]

NOTE: Support for the BNF rule `function` is added by the requirements class <<rc_functions,Functions>>.
