^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/advanced-comparison-operators/like-predicate*
^|A |The _like predicate_ (rule `isLikePredicate`) tests whether a string value matches the specified pattern. If the value matches the pattern (rule `patternExpression`), then the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `TRUE`. 
^|B |If the value does not match the pattern (`patternExpression`), then the predicate SHALL evaluate to the Boolean value `FALSE`.
^|C |If the character expression (rule `characterExpression`) and/or the pattern expression (rule `patternExpression`) in the predicate is `NULL`, then the predicate SHALL evaluate to the value `NULL`. 
^|D |The character expression (rule `characterExpression`) in rule `isLikePredicate` SHALL evaluate to a `characterLiteral`.
^|E |The wildcard character SHALL be the percent character (ASCII x25, `%`).
^|F |The wildcard SHALL match zero of more characters in the test value.
^|G |The wildcard character SHALL not match the NULL value.
^|H |The single character wildcard SHALL be the underbar character (ASCII x5F, `_`).
^|I |The single character wildcard SHALL match one character in the test value.
^|J |The single character wildcard SHALL not match the NULL value.
^|K |The escape character SHALL be the back slash (ASCII x5C, `\`).
